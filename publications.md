### Best Practices for Keeping Your Home Network Secure

* Abstract: Electronic computing devices including computers, laptops, printers, mobile phones, tablets, security cameras, home appliances, cars and other "Internet of Things" devices must all be secured in order to prevent attack. Most home entertainment and utility devices, such as home monitoring systems, baby monitors, Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Devices, Blu-ray players, streaming video players, and video game consoles are capable of accessing the Internet, recording audio, and/or capturing video. Implemented security measures can ensure these devices don't become the weak link in your home protection.

### A Guide to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Best Practices

* Abstract: The dominant routing protocol on the Internet is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP has been deployed since the commercialization of the Internet and version 4 of BGP is over a decade old. BGP works well in practice, and its simplicity and resilience enabled it to play a fundamental role within the global Internet. However, BGP inherently provides few performance or security protections.
With BGP being the primary protocol driving the Internet, the security of devices dedicated to running the protocol is vital. Unfortunately, there are many vulnerabilities that can be exploited if proper mitigations are not configured. This error seems to be far more common than it should. For that reason this guidance paper is provided.

### Cloud Security Basics

* Abstract: Cloud services provide enterprise organizations flexibility and new capabilities, however they introduce new risks that must be understood and addressed before procuring a cloud service provider (CSP). Department of Defense (DoD) organizations are charged with handling sensitive data ranging from Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to national security information. As more sensitive data is considered for storage and manipulation in cloud environments, organizations must address new security threats before deploying in an operational environment.

### Blocking Unnecessary Advertising Web Content

* Abstract: Cyber adversaries can leverage malicious advertising ("malvertising") to install malware. Exploit kits in malicious ads can take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities to silently install malware. Administrators should ensure that software updates are implemented promptly to prevent malware installation. Blocking potentially malicious web advertisements further mitigates malvertising. Additionally, blocking such content can decrease traffic across the network boundary, streamlining incident forensics and enhancing network performance.

### Mobile Device Best Practices When Traveling OCONUS

* Abstract: In their brief history, mobile devices have evolved to become the critical link between a remote user and the home office, providing travelers with access to business applications and data they would otherwise lack. Ensuring that this line of communication is private and secure is imperative. The security guidance outlined below applies to U.S. Government personnel using Government-issued commercial mobile devices in a public network as they travel in foreign countries. The purpose is to minimize an adversary's ability to obtain sensitive data through mobile devices and limit damage should one be compromised. The mitigations address a range of threats that might be encountered in foreign countries.

### Steps to Secure Web Browsing

* Abstract: Web browsers pose a unique risk to enterprise infrastructure because of their frequent exposure to untrusted dynamic content. Configuring browser security settings is challenging due to uncertainty of both attack mitigation effectiveness and impact on end users. A key goal of this paper is to avoid impact to users while mitigating as many attacks as possible. The following guidance uses a statistics-based approach to identify three mitigations in commonly-used web browsers that, in combination, will ward off nearly all publicly known attacks. Further mitigations are provided at the end of the document for administrators seeking to defend against adversaries with significant resources.

### Seven Steps to Effectively Defend Industrial Control Systems

* Abstract: Cyber intrusions into US Critical Infrastructure systems are happening with increased frequency. For many industrial control systems (ICS), it's not a matter of if an intrusion will take place, but when. The capabilities of our adversaries have been demonstrated and cyber incidents are increasing in frequency and complexity. Simply building a network with a hardened perimeter is no longer adequate. Securing ICSs against the modern threat requires well-planned and well-implemented strategies that will provide network defense teams a chance to quickly and effectively detect, counter, and expel an adversary. This paper presents seven strategies that can be implemented today to counter common exploitable weaknesses in "as-built" control systems.

### Inspection and Sanitization Guidance for Exchangeable Image Format (EXIF)

* Abstract: Exif is structured, tagged metadata contained within some media file formats. This data is used by digital camera manufacturers and applications that process digital images to provide additional information about media files. The metadata includes manufacturer specific information such as the make, model and lens information of the device that generated the file; image information (e.g. date/time of capture) and geolocation information (e.g. latitude/longitude) can also be recorded. Exif data is found in two image standards: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) File Interchange Format (JFIF) (as defined in International Standards Organization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 10918-1) and TIFF Revision 6.01. The Exif format is also defined for audio files in the format of Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE). This guidance document examines the Exif specifications for data attack, data hiding, and data disclosure risks that exist within the metadata structure. It provides a breakdown of each component of Exif metadata and provides recommendations that can help assure that Exif data is not only compliant with the specifications, but also free of risk.

### Inspection and Sanitization Guidance for MPEG-2

* Abstract: MPEG-2 is a standard for the generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information. It describes a combination of lossy compression methods for storage and transmission of audio and video using available storage media and transmission bandwidth. It includes an analysis of the issues with the H.264 advanced video coding, part 10 of MPEG-4. It also provides for inclusion of metadata such as Key-Length-Value, which can be obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle platforms capturing motion imagery. The MPEG-2 standard contains detail down to the bit level, fields that include metadata, conditional information, and variable length content require inspection to ensure data is not hidden or unintentionally disclosed. Given the typically large amount of data contained in MPEG-2 files, inspection and sanitization are critical to ensure that all content within the files can be displayed to end users and that files have no malicious content.

### Unicode Security Risks

* Abstract: Fundamentally, computers process numbers, not letters, so when a computer processes text, the characters must be converted into numbers prior to processing. There are many schemes for encoding characters as numbers. US-ASCII is one well-known scheme, but it encodes only the English (Latin) alphabet. By contrast, Unicode is an international standard that assigns a unique number to each of the characters in the world's languages. This document provides a brief overview of Unicode and discusses the potential security risks posed by using Unicode. It includes background on the growth of Unicode, definitions of commonly used Unicode terms, tips for creating filters to avoid visual spoofing attacks, and links to tools and further information.

### Inspection and Sanitization Guidance for National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF)

* Abstract: This Inspection and Sanitization Guidance (ISG) for National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF) document provides guidelines and specifications for developing file inspection and sanitization software for NITF files, which are formally defined by the National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (NITFS). The latest NITF 2.1 standard is defined in MIL-STD-2500C. NITF files contain numerous segments of data that include images, graphics, text, as well as custom data in a strict format. As with prior ISG documents, this document is concerned with data hiding, data disclosure, and data attack risks. For example, although the NITF standard is well-defined and contains detail down to the byte level, there remain fields that include metadata, conditional information, and variable length content that require inspection to ensure nothing is hidden within the file. The nature of NITF files is to include a variety of imagery and associated data that could potentially be displayed to an end user. Information can be selectively displayed to the user based on capability and the information that was requested. With potentially a large amount of data located in these files, inspection and sanitization is key to ensuring that information contained in the file is authorized for display to the user and that the data cannot be used to attack the system.

### Securing Kernel Modules on Linux Operating Systems

* Abstract: The Linux kernel is the core component of a family of Operating Systems (OS) that underpins a large number of government and commercial servers and infrastructure devices. Kernel functionality is commonly enhanced through the use of modules, which can be loaded at boot time or during normal system operation. Modules run at the same privilege level as the kernel. Any vulnerabilities in kernel modules present a serious risk. System owners are advised to 1) ensure that only signed kernel modules are loaded, and 2) prevent loading of unnecessary kernel modules. Although it reduces attack surface, preventing module loading is not practical for many general-purpose systems and thus is not suitable for use in compliance baselines.

### Devices with Intel Atom C2000 Series Processors

* Abstract: Devices with Intel Atom C2000 series processors can fail suddenly, impacting the availability of critical infrastructure and/or national security system networks. Intel Atom C2000 series processors manufactured since September 2013 (with B-0 stepping/version) could experience failure at above acceptable rates. The Low Pin Count (LPC) clock signal gradually degrades with use, potentially causing the device to cease operation and fail to boot. These processors are embedded in several types of network and enterprise devices (i.e., security appliances, network routers, and data storage devices). Suppliers are working with customers to replace or repair affected products. NSA recommends working with system suppliers as soon as possible to determine if devices are affected and create an appropriate replacement or repair strategy, depending on the criticality of the network system and use condition.

### Apply Kernel Protection on Windows 7 and Windows 7 SP1 - Updated

* Abstract: User mode and Kernel mode software may inadvertently or purposely access the NULL (0x00000000) memory page. This memory location has been leveraged in attacks to successfully exploit a system. Microsoft developed and released the KB28131702 patch (MS13-031) for 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 7 SP1 to mitigate this exploitation vector. The NULL page protection is part of Windows beginning with Windows 8 and onwards. IAVA 2013-A-0080 (KB2813170) was superseded by IAVA 2015-A-0009 and IAVA 2015-A-0033. However, those IAVAs do not address the requisite post-configuration registry value stated in the IAA document.
NOTE: This document supersedes IAA-U-OO-800824-17.

### Removal of Server Message Block 1.0

* Abstract: Server Message Block (SMB) 1.0 is a vulnerable, legacy file and print sharing protocol that has been deprecated by Microsoft. The SMB 1.0 protocol is susceptible to downgrade and man-in-the-middle attacks, and uses MD5 for hashing which is susceptible to collision and pre-image attacks. All supported versions of the Windows operating system support at least SMB 2.0 and do not require SMB 1.0 for regular file and print sharing functionality. At a minimum, Microsoft recommends disabling SMB 1.0, but complete removal is recommended when an operating system supports removal. If SMB 1.0 is still needed, then administrators should identify systems, devices, and software that only support SMB 1.0 and prioritize their removal, upgrade, or replacement.

### Overview of Software Defined Networking Risks

* Abstract: Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging technology, defined by the Open Network Foundation (ONF) as "the physical separation of the network control plane from the forwarding plane, and where the control plane controls several devices." While SDN offers new capabilities, it also introduces new risks. This document provides technical background, an overview of risks, and guidance for decision makers regarding SDN. For some networks, it may be impossible to mitigate critical risks due to architectural or implementation challenges.

### Reducing the Risk of Simple Network Management Protocol Abuse

* Abstract: SNMP provides a standardized framework for a common language that is used for monitoring and managing devices in a network. This protocol relies on the usage of a secure string, referred to as a community string, which grants access to a portion of a device's management plane.
There are several differences between SNMPv1, v2, and v3: SNMPv2 is nearly identical to SNMPv1, except 64-bit counters were added in order to support faster interfaces. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing that was used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. All versions run over user datagram protocol (UDP).
SNMPv3 should be the only utilized version of SNMP because it has the ability to authenticate and encrypt payloads. When either SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are utilized, the community string could be determined by an adversary by sniffing network traffic, which could then potentially lead to a man-in-the-middle and/or replay attack.
Using SNMPv3 by itself is not enough to prevent abuse of the protocol. Combining SNMPv3 with a Management Information Base (MIB) whitelisting approach using SNMP views can ensure that even with exposed credentials, information cannot be read from or written to the device unless the information is needed for monitoring or normal device re-configuration. The majority of devices that support SNMP contain a generic set of MIBs that are vendor agnostic, which allows for the Object Identifier (OID) to be applied to devices regardless of manufacturer.

### Long-lived Hashes for Active Directory SmartCard Required Accounts

* Abstract: It is well-known that passwords and their hashes can often be copied and reused by malicious cyber actors. Requiring smartcards or other hard tokens enables stronger authentication because they cannot be copied. Such a token can used by an adversary while the legitimate user is using it if an adversary has compromised the user's device, but not at other times or directly from other devices. When smartcards, are required to login to Windows Active Directory (AD) Domains, a random password is created and its hash is associated with the account. This allows the device (via the user's account) to use legacy authentication protocols such as NTLM to gain access to resources. In this case, the long random password is better than most user-chosen.

### Third Party Services Your Risk Picture Just Got a Lot More Complex

* Abstract: For some time now, the U.S. Government has sought the best means to protect national security interests without inappropriately undermining the value (i.e., innovation, efficiency) produced by the global information and communications technology (ICT) supply chain. While past efforts have focused on managing supply chain risk associated with manufactured equipment and software, the new emerging concern is managing the risks associated with outsourced services.

### Making Mitigations Matter Measuring Host Mitigation State

* Abstract: Mitigations are a significant factor when considering the risks applicable to a network and must be accounted for in order to provide a sense of priority to any additional mitigations that should be applied. This talk will explore means created or under development by NSA to accurately represent the state of mitigations on a network using automated risk scoring systems, with the results tied to the list of mitigations NSA believes are particularly critical. Specific topics include the Splunk Assessment of Mitigation Implementations (SAMI) capability and how mitigations can be covered in vulnerability assessment systems like DISA's Continuous Monitoring and Risk Scoring (CMRS) effort and DHS's Contiguous Diagnostics and Monitoring (CDM) program.

### Defending Against the Malicious Use of Admin Tools: PowerShell

* Abstract: Malicious actors are using our own tools against us. Why reinvent the wheel or drop something new, something distinguishable, when the tools used on every network every day will provide you all you need? This paper provides a strategy for hardening, defending, and detecting anomalous, and malicious, use of administrator toolsets. In particular, this paper will focus on Microsoft's PowerShell and will provide a methodology for hardening and defending it from adversarial use.

### Hardening Authentication Update

* Abstract: On many networks, in order for users to be granted access to network resources, a user must prove that he or she is an authorized user. This is the process of user authentication. A user can be authenticated by what he has (e.g. an ID card or token), what he knows (e.g. a PIN or password), or what he is (e.g. biometric data). More robust authentication processes use two or more of these factors, called multi-factor authentication.

### Outdated Network Devices and Unsecure Protocols and Services Expose Network Infrastructure to Compromise

* Abstract: Outdated network devices have known and unknown vulnerabilities that expose the network to severe risk. Unsupported, also called end-of-life, devices and software versions will not receive patches from vendors even for known vulnerabilities. Improperly secured communication protocols and services and insecure credentials increase the risk of unauthorized access and modification to the network infrastructure. When network infrastructure devices are deployed, these devices remain online for several years and are rarely rebooted, patched, or upgraded. Network infrastructure devices include routers, switches, access points, gateways, proxies, firewalls, and others. Common improperly secured protocols are Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Secure Shell (SSH), Telnet, and others. Networks must not use vulnerable devices and software versions or unsecured protocols unless absolutely necessary, and, if necessary, ONLY along with supplemental mitigations to detect and prevent compromise and lateral movement.

### Filter Sidecar Protocol (FSP) Specification

* Abstract: The purpose of this document is to describe the cross domain solution (CDS) Filter Sidecar Protocol (FSP). A filter sidecar is generally considered to be a network connected system, usually on a trusted operating system, that provides high assurance content inspection and sanitization functions for Cross Domain Solutions. The Filter Sidecar Protocol is intended to provide a mechanism for making new filtering capabilities available to an existing cross domain solution by adding a certified sidecar platform. As long as the CDS is tested to properly implement the Filter Sidecar Protocol, users should be able to add new content types without having to completely recertify the CDS since the filter sidecar would be separately certified.

### Guidelines for ConfigurationPatch Management in Industrial Control Systems

* Abstract: This document was written with contributions from Subject Matter Experts at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Security Agency (NSA). This document serves as an appendix to "Seven Strategies to Defend Industrial Control Systems". Application Whitelisting (AWL) can detect and prevent attempted exectution of malware uploaded by adversaries. The static nature of some industrial control systems (ICS) computers, such as database servers and human-machine interfaces, makes these ideal candidates to run AWL. In some situations deploying AWL on ICS computers is simple, but it can be challenging in others. Operators are thus encouraged to work with vendors to baseline and calibrate AWL deployments.

### Apple Quicktime Reaches End-of-Life for Windows Factsheet

* Abstract: Apple has officially ended support for QuickTime on Microsoft Windows. In January of 2016, Apple released the final update of QuickTime for Windows and removed the QuickTime plugin from browsers to help mitigate future vulnerabilities. In April of 2016, two new vulnerabilities were released, ZDI-16-241 and ZDI-16-242, that affect the most recent version of QuickTime for Windows. The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to remotely exploit a system by sending the victim a malicious .MOV file that is then viewed with QuickTime. Because Apple has ended support, Apple will no longer be deploying patches or future releases on Windows leaving the software unpatched. Windows systems running QuickTime are vulnerable until the software is removed. Apple and QuickTime are registered trademarks of Apple, Inc. and Microsoft and Windows are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corp.

### Application Whitelisting using Software Restriction Policies

* Abstract: Software Restriction Policies (SRP) enables administrators to control which applications are allowed to run on Microsoft Windows. SRP is a feature of Windows XP and later operating systems. It can be configured as a local computer policy or as domain policy using Group Policy with Windows Server 2003 domains and later. Using this guide, administrators can configure SRP to prevent all applications in their domain from running except applications they explicitly allow. Utilizing SRP as an application whitelisting technique significantly increases the security posture of the domain by preventing many malicious programs from executing.

### Spotting the Adversary with Windows Event Log Monitoring

* Abstract: This paper focuses on using the built-in tools already available in the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS). Central event log collection requires a Windows Server operating system version 2003 R2 or above. Many commercially available tools exist for central event log collection. Using a Windows Server 2008 R2 or above server version is recommended. There are no additional licensing costs for using the event log collection feature. The cost of using this feature is based on the amount of additional storage hardware needed to support the amount of log data collected. This factor is dependent on the number of workstations within the local log collection network.

### Inspection and Sanitization Guidance for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Internet Message Format (IMF), and Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)

* Abstract: Provide guidance for the development of an inspection and sanitization software filter for use with email messages. Email servers implement multiple specifications in order to send and receive email, three of which are covered by this document. The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to transmit email from a client to a server. The Internet Message Format (IMF) specifies the format of the email messages, both the headers and the body. The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) extends IMF beyond plain text. This document introduces the syntax of these standards and then discusses the components that have data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. It provides an analysis of these components and recommendations to mitigate their risks.

### Application Whitelisting Using Microsoft AppLocker

* Abstract: This guide describes Microsoft AppLocker settings recommended by the NSA's Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) for deploying location-based application whitelisting on your network. Alternative application whitelisting implementations that may support your organizational needs are commercially available. These alternative implementations may provide support to multiple different operating system platforms for a fee. This guide also provides administrators with a walkthrough on how to use AppLocker and implement the settings. Using AppLocker for application whitelisting enforcement will not stop all malicious software. It provides an additional layer in a defense-in-depth strategy. The intent of this guidance is to prevent users from unknowingly or accidentally executing malicious code or unauthorized software.

### Defending Against the Exploitation of SQL Vulnerabilities to Compromise a Network

* Abstract: United States Critical Infrastructure faces a significant risk from the exploitation of Structured Query Language (SQL) injection vulnerabilities. If executed successfully, an SQL injection may allow for the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a database and its contents; an outcome that may carry a high cost in system recovery and reconstitution, data restoration, downtime, regulatory penalties, and negative publicity. Due to the manageable level of complexity of SQL injection, the array of freely available tools that automate the exploitation process, and the techniques' demonstrated potential for impact, malicious cyber actors will continue relying on SQL injection vulnerabilities in public facing websites as a means of gaining access to critical infrastructure systems and networks.

### Inspection and Sanitization Guidance for the Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ) Biometric Image Format

* Abstract: The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for the development of a sanitization and analysis software tool for Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ) biometric files. WSQ is a compression algorithm formally defined in the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), WSQ GRAY-SCALE Fingerprint Image Compression Specification, IAFIS-IC-0110(V3). This document also refers to WSQ as a file type, since the data representing the entire image defined in is also commonly stored within a file. This document analyzes various elements and objects that are contained within the WSQ file structure and then discusses the data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. It describes how those elements can be a cause for concern for either hiding sensitive data or possibly attempting to exploit a system.

### Spotting the Adversary with Windows Event Log Monitoring

* Abstract: This paper focuses on using the built-in tools already available in the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS). Central event log collection requires a Windows Server operating system version 2003 R2 or above. Many commercially available tools exist for central event log collection. Using a Windows Server 2008 R2 or above server version is recommended. There are no additional licensing costs for using the event log collection feature. The cost of using this feature is based on the amount of additional storage hardware needed to support the amount of log data collected. This factor is dependent on the number of workstations within the local log collection network.

### Deploying Signed BIOSes to Enterprise Client Systems

* Abstract: This guide is meant to assist United States government and Department of Defense Windows system administrators deploy BIOSes to their enterprise client systems that support signed BIOSes and signed BIOS update mechanisms but do not have signed BIOSes installed by default due to these systems predating the NIST SP 800-147 standard. Vendors that implement signed BIOses currently ship systems with a signed BIOS already installed. This guide also provides information on tools for managing BIOSes that are freely available and officially supported by vendors for commercial use. The guide assumes administrators operate in a restrictive network environment where common remote management protocols may be blocked and common automation technologies may be disabled. Very basic techniques and technologies are used in this guide to apply to the widest audience possible and to allow easier integration into restrictive environments.

### JavaScript Security Risks

* Abstract: This document addresses the issues that JavaScript introduces into a document format. It shows how basic JavaScript can be manipulated and obfuscated to evade signature detection, by using publically available and known methods. Code that introduces both a data hiding and data attack risk can be difficult to detect, especially when the code is obfuscated. This paper presents some known methods to mitigate the risk of running JavaScript; however, at the moment, more research is needed to develop a more robust solution.

### Securing Data and Handling Spillage Events

* Abstract: Data spillage is the transfer of classified or sensitive information to unaccredited or unauthorized systems, individuals, applications, or media. A spillage can be from a higher level classification to a lower one. The data itself may be residual (hidden) data or metadata. Spillage may result from improper handling of compartments, releasability controls, privacy data, or proprietary information.The trend towards increased information sharing has weakened access controls, giving users without a need-to-know access to large volumes of sensitive or classified data. Malware that propagates via removable media has increased the risk of large data transfers outside the network. The risk of data spillage is a problem largely because of inadequate end user security awareness, unmanageable networks, and poorly implemented data policies.

### Defending Against Compromised Certificates

* Abstract: This guidance provides IT personnel with actionable information to defend against compromised CA and web site certificates, which could permit a malicious web server to impersonate the genuine one. Each operating system (OS) and browser may use different mechanisms to check and revoke trust in a certificate. Some use a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), while others use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). Still others rely entirely on the issuance of software updates, whose prompt application remains fundamentally important. Variety also exists in how browsers handle certificate validation. Some query the OS certificate store, while others use their own certificate store and thus must be configured separately. Finally, note that some sites may become inaccessible when enforcing strict revocation checking.

### Using Schematron for Cross Domain Security Policy Enforcement

* Abstract: This document provides recommendations for using Schematron schemas to enforce data constraints on the contents of Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents being transferred between security domains. Schematron is a rule-based schema language used for making assertions about patterns found in XML documents. The risk of transferring invalid or unauthorized XML data into or out of a sensitive security domain can be reduced by validating the XML data against a schema that fully describes and constrains the data. These more restrictive schemas are not necessarily the same as those that might be used to validate data being transferred within a single security domain. Schematron can be used as part of a Cross Domain Solution (CDS) to address security problems that may be difficult to solve using grammar-based XML Schema languages.

### New Smartphones and the Risk Picture

* Abstract: Mobile phone platforms are susceptible to malicious attacks, both from the network and upon physical compromise. Understanding the vectors of such attacks, level of expertise required to carry them out, available mitigations, and impact of compromise provides a background for certain risk decisions. In general, comparing risks introduced by the new generation of mobile devices to those of traditional, widely-deployed desktop systems provides insight into how the risks to DoD networks are changing. Due to the larger cultural and technological shift to mobile devices, this may be more relevant than comparison of diff erent smartphone brands.

### Protect Against Cross Site Scripting Attacks

* Abstract: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in web applications that allows an attacker to inject HTML, typically including JavaScript code, into a web page. XSS results from the intermingling of server code and user input. If user input is not sanitized correctly, it could contain code that runs along with server code in a client's browser. In 2010, XSS was ranked the #2 web application security risk by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the #1 software error by the SANS Institute. This factsheet explains ways to mitigate XXS attacks.

### Security Guidance for the use of XML Schema 1.0/1.1 and RELAX NG

* Abstract: This document provides guidance for creating Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schemas and Regular Language for XML Next Generation (RELAX NG) schemas that can be used to describe the format and contents of XML documents being transferred between security domains. The risk of transferring invalid or unauthorized XML data into or out of a sensitive security domain can be reduced by validating the XML data against a schema that fully describes and constrains the data. These more restrictive schemas are not necessarily the same as those that might be used to validate data being transferred within a security domain. As the popularity and usage of XML grows, so too will Cross Domain Solutions (CDS) that filter via schemas also grow; however, using poorly written schemas can undermine the security functionality of even the most well designed CDS.

### Application Whitelisting using Software Restriction Policies

* Abstract: Software Restriction Policies (SRP) enables administrators to control which applications are allowed to run on Microsoft Windows. SRP is a feature of Windows XP and later operating systems. It can be configured as a local computer policy or as domain policy using Group Policy with Windows Server 2003 domains and later. Using this guide, administrators can configure SRP to prevent all applications in their domain from running except applications they explicitly allow. Utilizing SRP as an application whitelisting technique significantly increases the security posture of the domain by preventing many malicious programs from executing.

### Suite B Implementer's Guide to Federal Information Processing Standard 186-3

* Abstract: This document specifies the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) from the "Digital Signature Standard" [FIPS186-3] that will be used in future and existing cryptographic protocols for Suite B products. It also includes the Suite B elliptic curve domain parameters, (NIST curves P-256 and P-384), along with example data for the ECDSA signature algorithm on these curves and auxiliary functions that are necessary for ECDSA implementations to be in compliance with [FIPS186-3] and Suite B.
[FIPS186-3] defines methods for digital signature generation that can be used for the authentication of binary data (commonly called a message), and for the verification and validation of those digital signatures. One of the approved techniques is the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) but additional requirements are specified.
This document includes requirements for obtaining the assurances necessary for valid digital signatures. Methods for obtaining these assurances are provided in the NIST Special Publication [SP800-89].
